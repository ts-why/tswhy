title: "Use Object.entries to iterate over object keys and values."
---

To loop over the keys and values of an object, use
[`Object.entries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries):

```ts
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(obj)) {
  /// ...
}
```
