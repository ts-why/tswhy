title: "'=' expected with type aliases"

Unlike interfaces, type aliases must have a left hand side and right hand side
of a statement, so code like this is invalid syntax:

```ts
type Person {
  age: number;
  name: string;
}
```

Instead it should look like this:

```ts
type Person = {
  age: number;
  name: string;
};
```
