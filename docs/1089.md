title: "'{0}' modifier cannot appear on a constructor declaration."

Some modifiers cannot be applied to class constructors:

```ts
class A {
  static constructor()
  abstract constructor()
  async constructor()
  readonly constructor() {}
}
```

Static constructor methods cannot be named `constructor` as the `constructor`
property already exists on objects and refer to the constructor of the object.
`create` is a common alternative name. Similarly, `async` can be applied to a
`static` "constructor". Marking a constructor as `abstract` doesn't make sense
since `abstract` only refers to members of the instance of a class. Constructors
cannot be assigned to, so `readonly` doesn't make sense.
