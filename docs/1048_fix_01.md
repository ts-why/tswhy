title: "Move out or destructure with initializers."
---

If you need the first few arguments to have initializers, you can move them out
of the rest parameter or destructure the argument and default the first few
members there.

```ts
function test(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ...rest: number[]) {}
// or
function test(...[a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ...rest]: number[]) {}
```
