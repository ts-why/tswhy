title: Multiple Lines
---

If you are trying to break a string across multiple lines, you can use template
literals using the backtick (`` ` ``) instead:

```ts
const str = `Here is some text
  that I want to break
  across multiple lines.`;
```

Or you can use string concatenation:

```ts
const str = "Here is some text" +
  "that I want to break" +
  "across multiple lines.";
```

Or you can use a backslash (`\`) at the end of the line:

```ts
const str = "Here is some text \
  that I want to break \
  across multiple lines.";
```
